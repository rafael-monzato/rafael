Short Term:

Right now, my main goal is to finish my graduation and make the most out of my internship. I've got a big interest in diving into the tech side of things, especially when it comes to the capital market. Also, I'm aiming to build stronger connections with my team – you know, soaking up the insights from those experienced leaders in this field. I think this direct interaction could have a major impact on how I develop.

Mid Term:

In the next phase, I'm thinking about going for an MBA abroad. It's a big move for me. This step is all about boosting my leadership skills and building up a network that opens doors in the professional world. I plan to use this executive education experience to put myself in the right place strategically and go after some important roles.

Long Term:



Looking ahead, my goal is to reach an executive-level position. I think everything I've learned so far, combined with my ongoing learning, will give me a solid foundation for a role that's all about organizational strategy. The insights shared by Alcaly, Guido, Annali, and Ricardo during their talks have helped light up the paths I want to follow in the future. It's making my vision of making a significant impact in an executive role even stronger – kind of like how they dealt with challenges when they were leading in the bank.


Since my adolescence, I have held the certainty that, regardless of the path I chose for my professional career and personal life, I aspired to make an impact on society. This conviction prompted me to explore platforms like Love Mondays, now known as Glassdoor, where I researched the work environment of various companies and the routines of their employees. It was through this exploration that I came across Bank of America. Many individuals shared their enriching work experiences, characterized by a global connection and constant learning. At that moment, an affinity began to develop, and Bank of America became a reference point for the trajectory I envisioned as I advanced in my university studies.

And here I am, responding to the question "What would you like the power to do?" with the goal I established back in my adolescence: to effect a tangible impact. At that time, the nature of this impact was not entirely clear, but over time, I found clarity in how I wished to shape it. Today, as I operate within the realm of technology for FICC, I am dedicated to contributing and, in the future, leading the development of technological solutions that revolutionize the financial market. My primary focus lies in the Brazilian capital market, which still carries untapped potential. I aspire to create an environment where our collaborators can make agile and precise decisions, and where BofA remains distinguished for its technologies, reinforcing our market leadership position and facilitating a positive impact on the lives of our current and future clients through our financial solutions.

Just as I shared experiences from my personal life earlier, I also believe that technology plays a pivotal role in a country's development. Therefore, I aim for the insights gained throughout my journey at Bank of America to continue enabling me to impact the lives of students in the basic education network.



Ethics is indisputable.
Being interested makes you interesting.
Making mistakes and owning them to learn how to get things right.


Much like the Bank, I believe in embracing risks in both my professional and personal life, but within a well-defined risk framework. It's about never losing sight of my core values that serve as the compass for my life's journey. It's holding myself accountable for the choices I make and understanding the ripple effect of my actions. Just as the Bank's success is built on calculated risks, my growth is anchored in a balanced approach that blends ambition with mindfulness."



During my journey at the Bank, I will primarily rely on the support of individuals within my field, such as my manager, who boasts international work experience and also began their career as an intern at the bank. Additionally, I will have the privilege of tapping into the extensive knowledge and professional background of our VPs, AVPs, and analysts. 

Moreover, I recognize the opportunity and responsibility to further explore connections with the Bank's executives. Their insights and experiences could help me pursue my objectives.
